# To-Do-List-Frontend-
The frontend is a simple To-Do List app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. `index.html` structures the app, `styles.css` handles the design, and `script.js` adds functionality for adding, completing, and removing tasks. This setup provides a clean and interactive user interface.
